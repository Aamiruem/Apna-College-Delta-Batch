🌍 What is the Internet?

The Internet is a global network of computers that are connected to each other so they can communicate, share information, and exchange data.

It’s like a massive web that connects millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks around the world.

⚙️ How It Works

Here’s the step-by-step idea:

Devices (computers, phones, servers) connect to the Internet through Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

These devices use a common set of rules called Internet Protocols (TCP/IP) to send and receive data.

Data travels across the Internet in packets — small chunks that carry your information (like text, images, or videos).

Routers and servers direct these packets to their destinations — like digital post offices!

🧠 Simple Analogy

Imagine the Internet as:

Highways → the cables and connections

Cars → the data packets

Addresses → IP addresses

Traffic signs → protocols (like HTTP, TCP/IP)

Websites → destinations

🌐 Key Components
Component	Description
ISP (Internet Service Provider)	Company that connects you to the Internet (like Jio, Airtel, BSNL)
IP Address	Unique number assigned to every device on the Internet
Router	Device that forwards data between networks
Server	Computer that stores and serves data (like websites)
Client	Your device that requests data (like your phone or laptop)
💡 Examples of Internet Use

Browsing websites (www.google.com)

Sending emails

Watching YouTube or Netflix

Using social media

Online gaming

Cloud storage and communication (Google Drive, Zoom, etc.)

🔗 Difference Between Internet and Web
Internet	World Wide Web
The physical network connecting devices	A collection of websites and web pages
Foundation layer	Runs on top of the Internet
Includes email, FTP, VoIP, etc.	Just one service of the Internet

✅ In short:

The Internet is the world’s largest network — a global system that lets computers and people communicate anywhere, anytime. 🌎💻
