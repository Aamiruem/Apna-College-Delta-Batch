🌐 What Is the Web (World Wide Web)?
The Web (short for World Wide Web, or WWW) is a collection of interlinked web pages and resources that you can access using the Internet through a web browser (like Chrome, Edge, or Firefox).
So in simple words:

🧠 The Internet is the infrastructure (the cables, routers, and servers).
🌐 The Web is the content that lives on top of it (websites, pages, videos, images).


⚙️ How It Works


You open a browser (e.g., Chrome).


You type a URL — like https://www.google.com.


The browser sends a request over the Internet to a web server.


The server responds with web files (HTML, CSS, JS).


Your browser displays them as a web page.
